Database: If you plan to store user moods, preferences, or activity logs, mention whether you’ll use MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Firebase, or Supabase.

Authentication: Note if you’re using NextAuth.js, Firebase Auth, or OAuth for login and user sessions.

APIs / Integrations: If you connect to external APIs (e.g., Spotify for music, OpenAI for mood analysis), list them.

Styling / UI: Specify the CSS framework or library — TailwindCSS, Chakra UI, Material UI.

State Management: If you use Redux, Zustand, or Context API, it’s good to highlight.

Dev Tools: Mention GitHub for version control, Vercel for CI/CD, and any testing frameworks like Jest or Cypress.

Future Enhancements: You can add a “Planned Tech” section (e.g., “Adding Supabase DB, integrating Spotify API”).
